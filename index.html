          <p>
            In the world of competitive gaming, "being carried" means letting
            your teammates do most of the heavy lifting while you contribute...
            sparingly. Whether it's due to skill gaps, bad luck, or just one of
            those days, being carried can happen to anyone. What matters is how
            you handle it—with humor, humility, and maybe a tiny bit of effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some examples of what being carried might look like in
            popular games:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Apex Legends:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your teammate racks up 12 kills and 3,000 damage while you
                  manage a single knock and barely 200 damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They’re clutch-reviving you for the third time in one match
                  while you’re still figuring out which gun to pick up.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <!-- Apex Lengends Ul -->

          <ul>
            <li>
              Overwatch:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your DPS teammate secures the play of the game with a perfect
                  Dragonblade or Deadeye, while your ult is still charging
                  because you forgot to stay in the fight.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The support player’s healing numbers make headlines while your
                  tank stats look more like an apology.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <!-- Overwatch UL -->

          <ul>
            <li>
              Fortnite:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your duo partner builds a fortress in 10 seconds and
                  eliminates half the lobby, while you’re still figuring out how
                  to rotate without taking fall damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They ping enemy locations like a pro, and you immediately give
                  away your position by accidentally shooting the sky.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            This documentation is your guide to embracing the art of being
            carried gracefully. From recognizing the signs to avoiding
            catastrophic mistakes, you’ll learn how to turn your supporting role
            into a comedic highlight rather than a team liability.

          <p>
            The first step in being carried gracefully is accepting the
            truth—you’re not the star of this show. It’s okay; even sidekicks
            get screen time. Here’s how to tell if you’ve been lovingly placed
            in the metaphorical backpack:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your stats are... Inspiringly bad:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In Apex Legends, your teammate has a 20-bomb badge, and you’ve
                  got a participation trophy with 87 damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In Overwatch, your kill count is so low that even the payload
                  is more helpful than you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In Fortnite, you’re the "team medic," except all you’ve done
                  is hand over bandages while they carry the Victory Royale.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <!-- Your stats are... Inspiringly bad -->

          <code>
            "Congratulations! You've contributed 87 damage. You're basically a
            warning shot."
          </code>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You’re always the rescue mission:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Knocked down? No problem. Your teammate has a permanent
                  timeshare in the Gulag or respawn beacon, just for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The number of revives you’ve received could be a mini-game
                  stat.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <!-- You're always the rescue mission -->

          <code>
            "I like to think of myself as the emotional anchor. They carry me,
            and I weigh them down just enough for them to feel challenged."
          </code>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The kill feed is suspiciously one-sided:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You’re scanning the feed like, "Wait, when did they wipe an
                  entire squad? I was still looting the first crate."
                </li>
                <li>
                  The only contribution you’ve made is a really enthusiastic
                  "Good job!" in voice chat.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <code>
            "Fun fact: If your name isn’t in the kill feed, you technically
            can’t be blamed for anything."
          </code>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You feel like a live tutorial:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Every game feels like a crash course, and your teammate is the
                  patient instructor saying, "It’s fine, we’ve all been there,"
                  while you die to fall damage... again.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <code>
            "They’re training me. Not for greatness—just for competence. Baby
            steps."
          </code>
          <p>
            Recognizing that you’re being carried isn’t an insult; it’s an
            opportunity. You’re not dead weight—you’re comic relief, moral
            support, and an inspiration to keep carrying on (literally). Once
            you’ve acknowledged your role, you can fully embrace it with the
            grace and humor of a truly lovable teammate.

        <p>
          Let’s face it, your carry isn’t expecting Shakespeare—they just need
          you to say something useful for once. Call out the enemy, mark some
          loot, or let them know when you’ve wandered off and immediately
          regretted it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep it simple: no one wants a monologue about how you got outplayed
          or why “your shots definitely hit.” And please, for everyone’s sanity,
          don’t panic-scream into the mic—it’s a battle royale, not a horror
          movie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Occasionally, toss out a “Nice shot!” or “Thanks for saving me…
          again.” But remember, this is a game, not a group therapy session.
          Stay chill, stay brief, and try not to sound like a malfunctioning
          GPS.

          This isn’t your anime protagonist arc. Rushing 1v3 isn’t heroic—it’s
          selling. Stick with your squad unless you want to star in someone

          Loot fast, fight faster. Your carry doesn’t have time for your

        <p>

        <p>
          <span>In short:</span> stay with your team, don’t oversell your
